# Alex Hutchings

Junior Developer at comparethemarket.com, soon-to-be graduate of Makers Academy, looking for the next big coding challenge! Enthusiastic and passionate for coding, I'm looking to further increase my programming capabilities, build and troubleshoot awesome applications, and meet some great people along the way.

**Tech Stack** : Mainly Ruby, with dabblings in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Projects

As a developer in training, I don't have many big/cool projects yet, but feel free to have a browse of my [GitHub Repos](https://github.com/alexh148?tab=repositories).

## Skills

#### Calm under pressure

I live by the ideology that you can accomplish anything with a clear mind.

My previous role, as a Service Delivery Analyst at comparethemarket.com, involved managing a wide variety of incidents, from site outages to regulatory issues. Naturally, incidents cause high amounts of pressure to get the issue resolved as quickly as possible. Throughout these events, I would always remain cool, calm, and collected, having a clear mind to think the situation through carefully, gathering all the right people to work together on the best solution for the customer and business, and keeping all stakeholders in the loop. 

#### Analytical

In my last 2 roles (Service Delivery Analyst and Desktop Services Analyst), being able to complete effective analysis was key (clues are in the job title really...). As a Service Delivery Analyst, I would regularly go through a root cause analysis of incidents, identifying weaknesses in controls and processes, and setting plans to rectify them.

#### Quick learner

I've always been able to pick up new skills quickly - Not sure how but whatever I'm doing seems to work ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

A prime example would be when I joined the Application Support team at BGL Group. I had no prior experience for the role and as standard, was allocated 13 days for training. I completed the training in 3 days and began troubleshooting technical problems on the 4th day.
